  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div id="about-me">
    <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Denos KUME, a passionate data science and analytics enthusiast. While I am a fresher in the professional world, my academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in extracting valuable insights from complex datasets. I specialize in utilizing advanced analytical techniques and machine learning algorithms to drive data-driven decision-making.</p>
    <p>I hold a degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://kristujayanti.edu.in/" target="_blank">KRISTU JAYANTI COLLEGE</a>, where I graduated with honors. During my studies, I discovered a deep interest in data science and analytics, which led me to immerse myself in learning and mastering various tools and technologies in this field.</p>
    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I worked on several projects that honed my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. One of my key projects involved developing a predictive model to analyze student performance, which provided actionable insights to educators for improving teaching strategies.</p>
    <p>In addition to my academic work, I actively participate in data science communities, contribute to open-source projects, and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the field. I believe in continuous learning and knowledge sharing as essential aspects of my growth in the tech industry.</p>
    <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a variety of interests and hobbies. I am an avid reader, particularly enjoying books on technology, psychology, and science fiction. I also love hiking and exploring the great outdoors, finding it a great way to unwind and get inspired. Music is another passion of mine, and I often spend my weekends strumming my guitar and experimenting with new tunes.</p>
